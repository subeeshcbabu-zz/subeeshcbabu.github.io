{% include githubsummary.html %}

I am a lead full-stack software engineer with 10 years of experience in large-scale, e-commerce web application development.

I am someone who enjoys contributing to open source projects, mainly to the JavaScript and Node.js community. I am proud to be part of the core infrastructure team, that helped drive Node.js adoption at companies like `PayPal` and `eBay`. I am one of the active maintainers of the `krakenjs` and `swaggerize` open source projects.

I am passionate about continuous integration (CI) systems, container based deployment solutions and application security practices. I get really excited about new technology and software trends and I always try to learn new things.
